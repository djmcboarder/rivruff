    <p> Quick Ride history: Formed in Oxford (home also to Radiohead and Foals) in 1988 they were one of the first and most influential shoegaze bands (influenced themselves by The Smiths). Ride broke up in 1996, Andy Bell (vocals/lead guitar/keys) formed the band Hurricane #1, played bass for Oasis, then guitar for Beady Eye who broke up in 2014. Ride re-formed in 2014 and released <i>Weather Diaries</i> in 2017 (worth checking out). Their forthcoming album <i>This Is Not a Safe Place </i> will be out in August. Andy says this song is about "the beginning of a relationship, when everything feels possible.”  They're playing NYC in <a href="shows.html" target="_blank">September</a>.</p>

Of the great <a href="https://youtu.be/RhhyrmF0C_s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a> for the song Stefan Babcock (vocals/guitar) said in a recent interview: “Before the song was released, we put out the lyrics and a basic chord chart and asked people to record their own versions without hearing the original first. It was a bit of a social experiment. We expected to receive 15 or 20 covers. We received 253. A lot of them were very… interesting… but most of them were actually really good." </p> <p>PUP's on a EU and UK tour this summer and comes back to NYC in <a href="shows.html" target="_blank"> September</a>. </p>

    <p>LA-based artist Kenny Becker is Goon. He says about the song: "I wanted to have the chorus never use any repeating phrases, which led to sorta stream-of-consciousness style lyrics. Because of that, this song isn’t really about any one thing. It sorta touches a lot of different weird ideas. Like datura flowers that grew in the canyon near the house that I grew up in, or questioning the effectiveness of praying for god to take away stomach pain of an old friend."</p>

    <p>This week I listened to A LOT of mediocre to bad music. ugh. The only positive was to be able to prevent you (hopefully) from having to go through that. This Los Angeles duo who relocated from the Bay Area gave me a reprieve with their ethereal vocals and a low-key dark, synthy sound. The guitar reminds me a little of a Fixx song. You can check them out live in <a href="https://www.elsewherebrooklyn.com/events/2019-06-01-chasms/" target="_blank">June</a>.</p>

    <p>Nice strings on this track and also the vocal part which comes in at around the 2:50 mark. It's not their best song, although those two elements make it worth hearing. Let's see what else is on the new album, out June 7th called <i>widow's weeds</i>. </p>

    <p>From their new record <i>Lux Prima</i>. The Yeah Yeah Yeahs frontwoman said in a recent interview "Going into this record, we were just gonna see what happened in the studio together. No commitments, no ties whatsoever, no labels involved. No nothing. It was purely, “Yeah, let’s just make some music” — like a kid in a sandbox. And it ended up being an expedition". Spike Jonze directed a live music video for this song on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.</p>

I'll be honest, the band's name caught my eye and I started digging to find some of their music. This song is from their new album, it gets in your head and spins around for awhile. They're <a href="https://www.markethotel.org/calendar/2019/12/14/she-past-away" target="_blank"> playing</a> in NYC in Dec (nothing like planning ahead!).</p>

    <p>This track is from a London four-piece who met while they were in high school making music in a bedroom. When asked if they had any advice for other bands trying to make it they siad “Don’t just expect people, ie your manager, or label etc, to do stuff for you. You have to be so proactive now; you can’t just sit on your arse and be a creative. You have to have a bit of a brain and as a result, people will respect you further down the line.”

Dom Goldsmith, the multi-instrumentalist-producer of the group: “I am slightly over-addicted to being in the studio, but I have horrendous tinnitus, and the only way I don’t concentrate on it is if I fill my room with sound. It’s like I have my own synthesizer in my head the whole time, oscillating ‘round and ‘round at full kilohertz, but I’m not deaf. My hearing is still good, and as an audiologist, that was the thing I was most worried about.”

    <p>Artist: Snail Mail</p> 
    <p>Track: Pristine</p>
    <p>Currently on tour with Interpol and Car Seat Headrest, this is a track from singer-songwriter Lindsey Jordan's band Snail Mail 2018 album <i>Lush</i>. They played four songs at MSG (I hustled there and only caught the last one). Jordan says of the evening: “I don’t think anybody really looked up, we were all looking at our feet, so no one was nervous or messing up or anything.”</p>

    <p>A track from the Los Angeles-based band's new album <i>Stuffed & Ready</i>. I caught a show at Mercury Lounge during their US tour in February and Clementine Creevy (founder, guitarist and lead vocalist) was having fun playing new songs while commanding the stage. It reminded me of what she said in a recent interview “Feminism and music are the two things I’m passionate about, I try to keep my life anchored in those two things, because that’s when I feel most myself.”</p>
